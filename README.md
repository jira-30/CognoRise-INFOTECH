Really delighted to be a part of CognoRise Infotech DATA SCIENCE INTERNSHIP program

TASK 1: IRIS FLOWER CLASSIFICATION 
----------------------------------
Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arshid/iris-flower-dataset

• The Iris flower dataset encompasses three distinct species: setosa, versicolor,
and virginica.

• These species are discernible through specific measurements. Imagine
possessing measurements of Iris flowers categorized by their distinct species.

• The goal is to train a machine learning model capable of learning from these
measurements and proficiently categorizing Iris flowers into their corresponding
species.

• Employ the Iris dataset to construct a model adept at classifying Iris flowers into
distinct species based on their sepal and petal measurements.

• This dataset serves as a prevalent choice for initial classification tasks, making it
ideal for introductory learning experiences

TASK 2: CREDIT CARD FRAUD DETECTION
-----------------------------------
Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud

• Develop a machine learning model designed to detect fraudulent credit card
transactions.

• The process involves preprocessing and normalizing transaction data,
addressing class imbalance concerns, and partitioning the dataset into training
and testing subsets.

• Train a classification algorithm—like logistic regression or random forests—to
differentiate between fraudulent and legitimate transactions.

• Assess the model's efficacy using metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score.

• Additionally, explore strategies like oversampling or undersampling to enhance
outcomes and refine the model's performance.

TASK 3: TITANIC SURVIVAL PREDICTION
-----------------------------------
Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/brendan45774/test-file

• Utilize the Titanic dataset to construct a predictive model determining if a
passenger survived the Titanic disaster.

• This project serves as an introductory exercise, offering accessible data for
analysis.

• The dataset comprises passenger details encompassing age, gender, ticket
class, fare, cabin, and survival outcome.

• By applying this data, you can embark on a classic project that provides
insights into survival patterns among Titanic passengers.

TASK 4: SUPERSTORE SALES PREDICTION
-----------------------------------
Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rohitsahoo/sales-forecasting

● Time series analysis deals with time series based data to extract patterns for
predictions and other characteristics of the data.

● It uses a model for forecasting future values in a small time frame based on
previous observations.

● It is widely used for non-stationary data, such as economic data, weather
data, stock prices, and retail sales forecasting.

TASK 5: CAR PRICE PREDICTION
-----------------------------
Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/goyalshalini93/car-data

• Numerous factors contribute to a car's price, encompassing brand reputation,
car features, horsepower, mileage efficiency, and more.

• Car price prediction stands as a significant domain within machine learning
research.

• If you seek to master the art of training a car price prediction model, this
project presents a valuable learning opportunity.
