TASK 1: IRIS FLOWER CLASSIFICATION

Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arshid/iris-flower-dataset
• The Iris flower dataset encompasses three distinct species: setosa, versicolor,
and virginica.
• These species are discernible through specific measurements. Imagine
possessing measurements of Iris flowers categorized by their distinct species.
• The goal is to train a machine learning model capable of learning from these
measurements and proficiently categorizing Iris flowers into their corresponding
species.
• Employ the Iris dataset to construct a model adept at classifying Iris flowers into
distinct species based on their sepal and petal measurements.
• This dataset serves as a prevalent choice for initial classification tasks, making it
ideal for introductory learning experiences
